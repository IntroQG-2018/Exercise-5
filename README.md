# Exercise 5: Viscous flow of ice

As we've seen previously, most landforms on Earth are sculpted by the flow of fluids across the landscape.
Erosion by glaciers can significantly change the Earth's surface, moving vast quantities of material from high elevations to lower elevations.
Glacial landscapes are unique and clearly reflect erosion by processes that differ greatly from those found in fluvial systems.
To understand how material is moved within glacial systems, it is important to first understand the dominant controls on glacier velocities.

For each problem you need to modify the given notebook, and then upload your files to GitHub.
The answers to the questions in this week's exercise should be given by modifying the document in places where you are asked.
Don't forget to include clear comments that explain what happens in each section of your code cells.

- **Exercise 5 is due by the start of class on on 3.12.**
- Don't forget to check out [the hints for this week's exercise](https://introqg.github.io/qg/lessons/L5/exercise-5.html) if you're having trouble.
- Scores on this exercise are out of 20 points.

This tutorial is based on a MATLAB exercise from [Prof. Todd Ehlers (University of TÃ¼bingen, Germany)](http://www.geo.uni-tuebingen.de/?id=2183).
